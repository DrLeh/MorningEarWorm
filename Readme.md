#MorningEarWorm

I have a tendency to wake up with songs in my head. Some of those songs seemed to be ones I felt that I hadn't even heard in a long time. I wrote this app to scrape my LastFM history to see when I had last heard that song. I was surprised when I saw that the song I woke up with in my head the day I wrote the app I hadn't listened to in two years, which I found very interesting.

I want to turn this into a twitter bot and possibly a phone app, so I can wake up and just enter the song name and artist that I woke up with in my head, and click a button and it would tweet something like:

> Today I woke up with Artist - Album in my head. It's been 415 days since I last heard this song!
